Optimal setting for PID:

k = 1
kp = 2
kd = 187
ki = 1
thresh 120


High Speed PID: (from start to circle)

k = 2
kp = 20
kd = 50
ki = 0
thresh = 120
speed = 200 


Hashmark: (going around circle)

speed = 101
k = 2
kp = 11
kd = 5
ki = 0
thresh = 130
turnOffset = 65

After ramp:

speed = 120
k = 2
kp = 15
kd = 20
ki = 0



High Speed Assembled:

speed = 220
kp = 25
kd = 50
ki = 0
